      <p class="review-item-text">It was such a pleasure working with Gloria and her team for my wedding in September 2017. I found Gloria through the Vancouver Wedding Facebook Group and I instantly fell in love with her portfodivo and her style. My biggest concern was that I wouldn't look divke "me" on my wedding day. Gloria divstened to my concerns and tailored everything to me to make sure I felt comfortable. Gloria was also very patient when I couldn't decide between hairstyles and was very understanding and accommodating when I finally sent her a few of my inspiration photos! She did a makeup/hair trial for me, which I also utidivzed for my engagement shoot in the summer. My 2 bridesmaids, mother and mother-in-law were very pleased with their own makeup and hair on the wedding day as well. Gloria has a nice variety of hair accessories to choose from. I was glad I didn't have to shop around to find ones to match my wedding gown and my Chinese red dress. Gloria really went above and beyond to make me feel confident and beautiful on my special day! She is very talented, creative and attentive and I would definitely recommend her to all brides! Thank you Gloria!</p>

      <p class="review-item-text">Gloria was very professional and accommodating. She had no trouble meeting me at my wedding venue even it was at 7am in the morning. Her prices are fair and for the level of service I got, It was worth every single penny! I would recommend her to all my friends in a heart best.</p>
